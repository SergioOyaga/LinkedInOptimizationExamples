# MathModelQueens
For this LinkedIn Queens problem, we use MIP to formulate and solve a linear problem.
In the [mathematical formulation](#mathematical-formulation) we can see how the problem sets, parameters, variables and 
constraints are defined.

## Mathematical formulation:
We have to represent the problem using lineal mathematical expressions.

## In this folder:
This folder contains two different classes and two packages that define the structures required for solving the problem.
These classes are used as main and controller.
1. [Controller](#controller): Controller that communicates the UI with the MathematicaModel.
2. [RunLinkedInQueens](#runlinkedinQueens): The main class for instantiation of the frontend.


The records created to contain the problem information.
1. [MathModel](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/LinkedInOptimizationExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/Queens/MathModelQueens/MathModel/):
    Package with the mathematical model built using the OptimizationLib.mm module.
2. [UI](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/LinkedInOptimizationExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/Queens/MathModelQueens/UI/):
   Package with the UI for the MathModel LinkedIn Queens problem.

### [Controller](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/LinkedInOptimizationExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/Queens/MathModelQueens/Controller.java):
This Class controls the communication between the UI and the math model running in the back.

### [RunLinkedInQueens](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/LinkedInOptimizationExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/Queens/MathModelQueens/RunLinkedInQueens.java):
This is the main class. Is where the run starts. As simple as instantiate the UI.


## Results
We solve the problem using:
```` java
    @Override
    public void initializeModelRequest() {
        this.getProtoModelRequest()
                .setEnableInternalSolverOutput(true)
                .setSolverTimeLimitSeconds(600)
                .setSolverType(MPModelRequest.SolverType.SCIP_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING);
    }
````
As solver SCIP, a max time of 10 minutes and asking the solver to plot the solving info, which looks like:

## Comment:
This problem is solved using the power of Mixed Integer Linear Programming. It is just a guide that the user can follow 
to build its own problems.

In this example, we didn't conduct an extensive optimization of the variables and constraints created. 
Nevertheless, we were able to get in a pretty sort time the solutions for the scenario. :smirk_cat:
